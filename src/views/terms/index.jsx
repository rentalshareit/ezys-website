        </p>
        <span style={{ color: "#818181" }}>
          If a customer reports an issue with the rented product during the
          rental period, Ezys will inspect the product upon its return to verify
          the issue.

        </p>
        <span style={{ color: "#818181" }}>
          If the reported issue is found to be genuine after inspection, the
          rental fee will be recalculated based on the per-day price. Since Ezys
          operates a rental model where the per-day cost decreases with longer
          rental durations, the customer will be charged according to the
          reduced per-day rate for the days the product was in use until the
          issue was reported. Example: If an item was rented for 10 days at
          ₹2,000 and a genuine issue is reported on Day 6, the rental fee will
          be recalculated based on the per-day rate for the 5-day duration
          (e.g., ₹200/day), resulting in a charge of ₹1,000 for 5 days, with the
          remaining amount refunded.

        </p>
        <span style={{ color: "#818181" }}>
          If no issue is found after inspection, the customer will be charged
          for the full rental duration as per the rates mentioned on the Ezys
          website for that rental period. Example: If the same item was rented
          for 10 days at ₹2,000, and the issue is reported on the 6th day but
          found to be invalid, the rental will be charged at the full 5-day rate
          (e.g., ₹1,500), as mentioned on the website.

          Refunds will be processed based on the recalculated rental amount,
          considering the validity of the reported issue and the applicable
          per-day rental rate. Refunds will be processed within 3 business days
          after the product has been inspected.
